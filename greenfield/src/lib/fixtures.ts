  "solo-cpa-workflow-os": `## Overview
A practice-management workspace for solo CPAs, organised around the client engagement rather than the firm's internal hierarchy. The MVP target is a working timeline for the 1040 (personal tax return) engagement, with document collection, deadline tracking, and client-portal reminders.

## Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage) — no separate API layer needed for MVP
- **Documents:** Supabase Storage for raw uploads; pgvector for semantic search inside docs
- **Email:** Postmark for client-portal magic links + reminder emails
- **Payments:** Stripe Billing, monthly subscription at $59
- **Hosting:** Vercel

## Data model
- \`organizations\` — one per CPA firm (typically 1 user)
- \`clients\` — the CPA's clients
- \`engagements\` — \`belongs_to client\`, \`engagement_type enum('1040', '1120', 'bookkeeping', ...)\`
- \`engagement_steps\` — the timeline events (request_documents, review, sign, file)
- \`documents\` — \`belongs_to engagement\`, with extracted metadata (form_type, tax_year, amount)
- \`client_portal_tokens\` — short-lived magic-link tokens for clients

## Core flows
1. CPA creates a client → creates a 1040 engagement → system seeds the standard 1040 timeline
2. CPA clicks "request documents" on a step → templated email with magic-link to client portal
3. Client uploads documents to portal → CPA gets a notification → document auto-tagged by form type
4. CPA reviews → marks step complete → next step's reminders auto-schedule

## Week-1 milestones
- Auth + org creation
- Client CRUD
- Engagement creation with a hard-coded 1040 timeline
- Document upload to engagement
- Deployed to staging with one paying pilot CPA

## Week-2 to launch
- Client portal (magic-link auth, upload UI, status view)
- Email templating + scheduling (Postmark)
- Document auto-tagging (call Anthropic with the PDF, extract form_type, tax_year, employer)
- Stripe Billing for $59/mo subscription
- 10 paying pilot CPAs at $1/mo to ship monthly

## Risks & open questions
- **Risk:** CPAs are extremely habit-formed; expect slow conversion off existing tools. Counter with a one-call onboarding included in the $59.
- **Open:** Should documents flow back into QuickBooks? (Defer to v2.)
- **Open:** Multi-client portal vs. per-client portals? Single client portal is simpler and matches the user mental model.`,

  "soc2-readiness-as-a-service": `## Overview
A productized SOC 2 readiness engagement for early-stage startups: 30 days, $15k flat, ending in a Type I report. You operate the engagement using Vanta or Drata as your internal tooling — the customer is not buying software, they're buying the outcome.

## Stack
You're a service business. Your "stack" is operational, not technical.
- **Internal tooling:** Vanta Trust Pricing or Drata Starter ($7-15k/year)
- **Customer-facing:** Notion playbook, Google Workspace for delivery
- **CRM / pipeline:** HubSpot Starter or Attio
- **Billing:** Stripe Invoicing (not Subscriptions) — one-time invoices
- **Scheduling:** Cal.com for the kickoff and 4 weekly working sessions

## Data model
N/A — your "data" is a Notion playbook with one page per customer and structured fields for control status.

## Core flows
1. **Sales call** (30 min, sell the outcome not the process)
2. **Kickoff** (90 min, day 1) — credentials access, policy gap assessment, schedule check
3. **Week 1-2 working sessions** — policies authored, controls implemented
4. **Week 3 evidence gathering** — Vanta populated, observation period started
5. **Week 4 audit hand-off** — to your auditor partner (CyberGuard, Strike Graph, etc.)
6. **Day 60-90** — auditor delivers Type I report

## Week-1 milestones (of YOUR business)
- Sign 2 letters of intent at $15k
- Write the Notion playbook from your existing compliance knowledge
- Sign a reseller agreement with Vanta or Drata
- Sign a referral agreement with one auditor (10% commission to them)

## Week-2 to launch
- Land your first contract; deliver it yourself
- Post a public case study after delivery
- Add a self-serve booking page on the website

## Risks & open questions
- **Risk:** Vanta/Drata may try to compete with you by offering "concierge". So far they haven't because the gross margin is bad for them. Move fast.
- **Open:** Type I vs. Type II? Start with Type I (point-in-time) — it's a 30-day engagement. Type II requires a 3-month observation, much longer sales cycle. Add as v2 offering.`,

  "synthetic-test-data-api": `## Overview
A usage-based API that takes a database schema (or a sample of real data) and returns realistic-looking synthetic rows that preserve statistical shape and referential integrity. Sold to engineering teams in regulated industries (healthcare, fintech, payments) who can't safely use production snapshots in staging.

## Stack
- **API:** FastAPI (Python) or Hono (TypeScript) — synchronous for small requests, queued for large
- **Generation engine:** Mix of Claude 4.5 Haiku (for categorical fields) and SDV / Gretel-style stat-preserving generators
- **Storage:** Postgres for accounts, S3 for generated payloads
- **Async jobs:** SQS + worker fleet
- **Hosting:** Fly.io or Railway for the API; Modal for the GPU workers
- **Auth:** API keys, rate-limited per key
- **Billing:** Stripe Metered Billing — \`rows_generated\` events posted nightly

## Data model
- \`accounts\` — customer org
- \`api_keys\` — \`account_id\`, prefix, hashed secret, scope (free/paid)
- \`schemas\` — saved schemas with field-level synthesis configs
- \`generations\` — log row per API call (rows, latency, model used, cost)
- \`usage_events\` — daily aggregate pushed to Stripe

## Core flows
1. Sign up → API key issued → free tier (100k rows/mo)
2. \`POST /v1/generate\` with \`{ schema, rows }\` → returns NDJSON or signed S3 URL
3. \`POST /v1/learn\` with sample rows → produces a fitted synthesizer config they can name and reuse
4. Usage exceeds free tier → automatic conversion to paid, Stripe Metered records each row

## Week-1 milestones
- Working CLI for one schema (Stripe-like payments) generating realistic transactions
- Account + API key system
- Hosted demo page that generates 100 rows in <2s

## Week-2 to launch
- Three pre-built schemas live (Stripe, FHIR, generic Postgres dump)
- Async generation for >10k row requests
- Stripe metered billing wired
- Docs site + Postman collection

## Risks & open questions
- **Risk:** Quality of generated data is the entire product. Build an automated eval suite from day 1 (statistical distance to source, FK integrity, edge case coverage).
- **Risk:** Tonic.ai and Gretel are real competitors. The wedge is price and DX — be 10x cheaper at <100M rows/mo than Tonic and 10x easier to integrate.
- **Open:** Self-hosted enterprise tier? Probably yes by year 2.`,
