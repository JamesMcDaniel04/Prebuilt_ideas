const GTM_OUTPUT = `# Wedge plan: Solo CPAs running 1040 engagements out of multi-tool sprawl

## ICP (one buyer)
- **Solo CPA** with 80–250 active 1040 clients, billing $300–$1,200 per return.
- Running Karbon or nothing + Calendly + Dropbox + Gmail.
- Diversifying away from 1040 into year-round advisory but bottlenecked on document collection during Jan–Apr.

## Triggering event (why they'd switch now)
The CPA just survived a busy season where 30% of client-portal escalations were "where do I send the W-2 again?". They want one timeline per client, not one inbox per task.

## Initial offer
- $59/mo, billed annually
- Includes: client portal + 1040 timeline + email reminder automation
- No deferred-discount play, no per-client charges, no setup fee

## First channel
Niche newsletters and the r/Bookkeeping / r/Accounting subreddits — those are the only places solo CPAs actually congregate before tax season ramps.

## Week-1 plan
1. Cold-DM 30 solo CPAs on Bluesky + LinkedIn who recently complained about Karbon pricing
2. Offer the first 10 a $1/mo pilot — the price they pay is the right to talk to them monthly
3. Build a stripped landing page focused on "your 1040 timeline, one screen"

## Kill criterion
If 0 of the 30 cold DMs convert to a pilot conversation by end of week, the wedge is wrong. Pivot to bookkeepers (the adjacent persona) before broadening.

## Handoffs
- **Sales:** start with my outbound list (30 CPAs); track which Karbon complaint resonates most.
- **Marketing:** write landing-page copy around "one timeline per client" — keep the Karbon comparison implicit, not direct.
- **Engineering:** scope the 1040 timeline first; defer the 1120 / bookkeeping flows until 10 pilot CPAs say they need them.`;

const SALES_OUTPUT = `# Design-partner list + objection log starter

## 12 target accounts (cold-warm)

| Firm | Headcount | Signal | Hook |
|---|---|---|---|
| Smith & Hanks CPA, Austin | Solo | Posted about Karbon price hike on LinkedIn 4 days ago | "Your timeline gripe was the third one I read this week — happy to share what 10 others are switching to" |
| RiverlineTax, Boulder | Solo | Asked in r/Bookkeeping "what do you use to collect docs?" | "Saw your r/Bookkeeping post — here's the timeline we built for that exact problem" |
| Lerner Accounting, Brooklyn | Solo | Liked our launch tweet | "Noticed you've been following Greenfield — interested in a 15-min demo?" |
| (+ 9 more from the GTM agent's research) |  |  |  |

## Outreach sequence (5-touch, 9 days)

**Day 0 — LinkedIn message** (under 70 words, references the specific public signal)
**Day 2 — Email** (one-paragraph case for the 1040 timeline, no attachments)
**Day 4 — Reply with proof** (single screenshot of the timeline)
**Day 7 — Soft offer** ("$1/mo for 6 months in exchange for monthly feedback")
**Day 9 — Polite close** ("Closing the loop — let me know if the timing's off")

## Objection log (priming the response)

1. **"I already pay for Karbon."** → "Most pilot CPAs cancel Karbon at month 3. We migrate your client list for free."
2. **"I don't have time during tax season."** → "Setup takes 18 minutes. The first benefit shows up the day after."
3. **"My clients are non-technical."** → "Magic-link portal — no password, no app to download."

## Handoffs
- **GTM:** confirm the $59/mo price holds against the Karbon "we'll match" defense.
- **Marketing:** I'll need a 1-pager I can attach in Day 2 emails — same shape as the landing page.
- **Engineering:** I'm assuming the magic-link portal works on day 1. Flag if that's slipping.`;

const MARKETING_OUTPUT = `# Messaging house + week-1 launch asset pack

## Core positioning (one sentence)
A workspace for solo CPAs that organises the year around the **client engagement**, not the firm's internal hierarchy — so every document, deadline, and reminder lives on one timeline per client.

## Three-line story (use everywhere)
1. **The gap:** Solo CPAs run their practice on Karbon + Dropbox + Gmail + Calendly + Excel — five tools that don't share a timeline.
2. **The play:** One screen per client. Documents, deadlines, sign-offs, and reminders on a single timeline. AI handles the grunt work; you stay the operator.
3. **The pull:** $59/mo, annual, no per-client charges, no setup fee.

## Week-1 assets

- **Landing page hero**
  > **One timeline per client. The rest of your tools, retired.**
  > A practice-management workspace for solo CPAs, built around the 1040 engagement first.
- **Product screenshot (caption)** — "Day 1 of a 1040 engagement: document checklist, client reminders, your sign-off — one screen."
- **Founder LinkedIn post (90 words)** — anchored to "I built this because my dad's CPA still emails him a PDF checklist every January."
- **Tweet thread (5 tweets)** — opens with the Karbon price-hike screenshot, closes with the pilot link.
- **Reddit comment template** — for r/Bookkeeping / r/Accounting threads. Helpful first, link second.
- **Cold email v1** — three paragraphs, no logo, one CTA ("a 20-minute Loom walkthrough").

## Distribution channels (in order)
1. Niche newsletter sponsorships ($500-$1,500 per send)
2. Founder-led posts on LinkedIn + Bluesky
3. Reddit (manual, not automated; ban risk if you sound salesy)
4. Cold outbound (Sales agent's list)
5. SEO content — defer until pilot 5+

## Handoffs
- **Sales:** I'll have the 1-pager ready by Wednesday for the Day-2 emails.
- **Engineering:** product screenshot needs the magic-link portal in shot — confirm it ships in the demo build by Friday.
- **GTM:** pulling the Karbon comparison out of the hero copy per your "keep it implicit" note.`;

const ENG_OUTPUT = `# MVP scope + week-1 build sequence

## What ships in the MVP (everything else is out of scope)

1. **Auth + org** — Supabase email/password + Google. Each CPA is a one-person org.
2. **Clients CRUD** — name, email, tags, status. No imports yet.
3. **1040 engagement** — one engagement type only. Pre-seeded timeline of 11 steps.
4. **Document upload** — Supabase Storage, magic-link client portal.
5. **Email reminders** — Postmark, three templates (request docs, nudge, sign-off ready).
6. **Stripe Billing** — single $59/mo annual subscription.

## What's NOT in MVP
- Multiple engagement types (1120, bookkeeping) — every conversation defers these.
- QuickBooks integration — comes back via the GTM channel scorecard.
- Native mobile app.
- Document OCR / auto-categorisation.
- Team seats (we're solo-first).

## Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, Tailwind, shadcn/ui (matches the Greenfield brief).
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions). One service.
- **Email:** Postmark, server-only.
- **Payments:** Stripe Billing checkout link (no webhook flow in v1 — manual upgrade ops for first 50 customers).

## Data model (Postgres)
\`\`\`sql
clients (id, org_id, name, email, status, created_at)
engagements (id, client_id, type, status, opened_at)
engagement_steps (id, engagement_id, ordinal, kind, due_at, completed_at)
documents (id, engagement_id, storage_path, doc_type, uploaded_by, created_at)
portal_tokens (token, engagement_id, expires_at)
\`\`\`

## Instrumentation (so the rest of the team can see whether the wedge works)
- Time-to-first-document-uploaded per engagement
- Reminder open rate per template
- Days from engagement open → all-documents-collected

## Week-1 milestones
| Day | Ship |
|---|---|
| Mon | Auth + clients CRUD + Stripe link |
| Tue | 1040 engagement creation + seeded timeline |
| Wed | Document upload + magic-link portal |
| Thu | Email reminder loop (Postmark) |
| Fri | Two pilot CPAs end-to-end on staging |

## Handoffs
- **Sales:** magic-link portal will be live by Friday — confirmed for the Day 2 emails.
- **Marketing:** product screenshot will hit a clean staging account on Wednesday.
- **GTM:** instrumentation above gives you the channel scorecard inputs by week 2.`;
